# Elmore Delay Model for Timing Delay Algorithm
### Elmore Delay Calculation in PERL
#### EEL4932 - Grace Brazil Fall 2019 

## Running the script in your terminal:
1. cd into the location where you saved the perl script
> cd /Desktop/Sandbox

2. run the perl script (UNIX)
> perl elmore.pl

How do I know if I have the interpreter?  
>'perl -v' 

try it in your terminal, if it gives you an error you don't have it!
If you don't have it go here: http://www.perl.org/get.html
Afterwards, you should be able to do perl <space> anyperlscript.pl in your terminal


## After running the script:
You will be getting one output per input file and one file for summary. For 01.in you will be getting  01.out and for 02.in and 02.out

- the 01.out will contain the final cut and the partition assignment of Node 1 to Node n
- the summary.out will contain the input file's initial cutsize, initial execution time in calculating initial cutsize, final cutsize and time elapsed for the final cutsize

### Disclosure
The code is still work in progress. Check back later for updates.
